Hi thereðŸ‘‹! My name's iDevourCookies. 
At the moment, I'm not very skilled at any programming languages, although I have learnt the basics in quite a few languages, and I have settled on Python.
I am currently following CS50's introduction to Python, and I plan on making a few projects when I am done.
Since I've always wanted to learn game development, but I also like the idea of autopmation, I thought: 
"Why not learn Python, a language that can easily be used to automate things, but also has Pygame, an easy way to develop games?"
And although Pygame isn't the best, I'm sure I can make it work. Oh, and another reason I chose Python is simply because I'm biased :P
